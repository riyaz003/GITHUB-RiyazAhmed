1. What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage by using elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. 

2. Are HTML tags and elements the same thing?
No, HTML tags and elements are related but not the same:

HTML Tags: These are the building blocks that define the start and end of an HTML element. They are enclosed in angle brackets (< >). For example, <p> and </p> are tags for a paragraph.

HTML Elements: These include both the opening tag, the content between the tags (if any), and the closing tag. For example, <p>This is a paragraph.</p> is an HTML element.

3. What are tags and attributes in HTML?
Tags: Tags are keywords enclosed in angle brackets, used to define elements in HTML. They come in pairs, with an opening tag (e.g., <h1>) and a closing tag (e.g., </h1>), though some tags are self-closing (void elements).

Attributes: Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are specified within the opening tag.

4. What are void elements in HTML?
Void elements (also known as self-closing elements) are HTML elements that do not have closing tags and cannot contain any content. Examples include:

<img> (image element)
<br> (line break)
<hr> (horizontal rule)
<input> (input field)

6. Difference between HTML and XHTML (Point-wise)
HTML: Allows flexible syntax (e.g., closing tags can be omitted for some elements).
XHTML: Follows strict XML rules (all tags must be properly closed).
Tag Case Sensitivity:

HTML: Tags are not case-sensitive (e.g., both <h1> and <H1> are valid).
XHTML: Tags must be written in lowercase (e.g., <h1> is valid, but <H1> is not).
Document Structure:

HTML: More lenient in document structure and does not require well-formed documents.
XHTML: Requires well-formed documents and a proper structure, following XML guidelines.
Error Handling:

HTML: Browsers are more forgiving of mistakes and can still render pages with errors.
XHTML: Browsers enforce strict error handling, and even minor mistakes may break page rendering.
