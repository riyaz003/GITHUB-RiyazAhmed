        <h1>about H2R</h1>
        <p>
            The Ninja H2 R is a revolutionary bike because it is one of a kind.
             This is the only bike on the planet equipped with a stock supercharger, thanks to the remarkable collaboration within Kawasaki Heavy Industries.
              The fastest production bike has multiple speed records, with Kenan Sofuoglu's 248.548mph (400km/ph) run being the most notable. 
              Sofuoglu achieved the top speed in under 26 seconds. As ironic as it might sound, the fastest bike on Earth is made for veterans bored with their average-liter bikes and want something that will give them a new adrenaline rush on track.
